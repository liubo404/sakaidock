K1 K2 Roadmap   	  Edit </group/sakai-kernel/edit/k1-k2-roadmap?hl=en>

		


  K1 and K2 Roadmap


This document outlines the Roadmap of Sakai Kernel 1 and Sakai Kernel 2
and places this development in context with Sakai releases. It does not
look at a wider Sakai Roadmap which is the subject of
the separate document, however this document must be read in conjunction
with other Sakai roadmaps.

The aim of continuing to develop a Sakai kernel is to

    * Improve the Quality, Scalability and Performance of the Sakai Kernel
    * Address the requirements expressed by the community
    * Improve the efficiency of the developers within the community. 


This will be delivered in a 2 phase approach, K1 and K2 marking the
releases at the end of each of those phases. K1 will prepare the
community for the kernel release by moving the community to a kernel
release without changing any API's or functionality. Once the community
has a single, small set of artifacts that can be identified as the
kernel, the the K2 release will provide significant enhancements to the
3 primary goals. The K2 release will maintain
backwards compatibility with K1 using a compatibility layer.


    Activities and Deliverables

The activities and deliverables on the Roadmap are outlined below. The
deliverables are highlighted in *bold*


    K1 Activity and Deliverables

    * Repackage a subset of the exiting core code into to a single
      central package that will improve the speed of development towards
      the 2.6 release of Sakai* (**K1 API**,* *K1 Implementation**).*
    * Gather requirements and document design for a significant 
      comparative performance,  predictive scalability and quality
      testing component that will enable automated acceptance testing
      within stakeholder organizations. (*K1 Test Requirements Document*)
    * Implement and deliver a testing framework to driven from the above
      requirements with the intention of supporting the creation of the
      tests themselves and the running of those test. (*K1 Test Harness*)
    * Implement and deliver a suite of tests that address the need of
      the K1 Test Requirements Document. (*K1 Test Suite*)
    * Perform a code freeze on K1 (*K1 RC1*) 4 months prior to the code
      freeze of Sakai 2.6 
    * Perform a release of K1 (*K1 GA*) 2 months prior to the code
      freeze of 2.6 such that K1 is delivered within the 2.6 release of
      Sakai. 



    K2 Activity and Deliverables 


    * Gather and document the requirements of the community stake-holders, the importance of those requirements to be balanced by the impact on the adoption of Sakai. (*K2 Requirements Document*) 

    * Progress the community to agree on a deliverable set of requirements, within available resources and to an agreed time-scale. (Scope-Resources-Time balance) 

    * Deliver a design document to the community that details the design of the new kernel. (*K2 Design Document*) 

    * Perform and report on a feasibility study of key kernel components and technologies with collaboration from critical stake-holders identified from the requirements process within the community. (*K2 Feasibility Study*) 

    * With resources donated donated from stake-holders within the community implement the design as agreed by the community. (*K2 API*,* K2 Implementation*) 

    * Implement a compatibility layer using K1 code, to enable K1 based tools to operate with the K2 kernel. (*K2 Compatibility Layer*) 

    * Implement a full suite of unit and integration tests during the development of the kernel to ensure greater than 80% code coverage within the kernel, and report on that code coverage (K2 Code Coverage Report) 

    * Produce a technical user manual for the new kernel. (*K2 Technical User Manual*) 

    * Code freeze on K2
      (*K2-RC1*)4 months before the code freeze of the 3.0 Sakai release. 
    * Release K2 2 months before the code freeze of the Sakai NG
      Beta. (*K2 GA Release*) 
    * Apply the K1 Test Suite to the K2 Kernel with Compatibility layer. (*K2 Compatibility Report*)



*Cambridge Hackathon K2 Notes (Tuesday July 8, 2008):*

   1. Storing content as content (being aware of relational stuff,
      possibly using Cayenne)
         1.     Need some feasibility studies using off the shelf
            technology (Jackrabbit, Sling)
         2.     Some fear of repeat of the XML blobs in the database 
   2. Minimize the code base
         1.     Use 3rd party JARs where possible 
   3. Starting small
         1.     Develop one service and test (Add other services outside
            kernel) 
   4. Dependency injection
         1.     Very lightweight, focused on dependencies only
         2.     Spring is too heavyweight.
         3.     Look at pico and guice 
   5. Component manager
         1.     Lightweight
         2.     Reloadable
         3.     OSGI? (but not spring’s osgi implementation)
               1.         Need to embed a servlet container 


    Relationship to Sakai releases


    * The K1 release (K1 GA Release) will be available for use in Sakai
      2.6. 
    * The K2 release (K2 GA Release) will be available for use in Sakai
      NG Beta. 



    Sakai 2.6


    Sakai NG Beta

    * K1-GA 24 September 2008
    * K2-RC1 22 October 2008
    * K2-GA 19 November 2008 


      Deliverable Dates

    * K1 API 30 July 2008
    * K1 Implementation 12 August 2008
    * K1 Test Requirements Document 30 July 2008

    * K2 Compatibility Layer 19 September 2008
    * K2 Technical Users Manual 30 September 2008 



      Expected Sakai Release Dates

If the above release schedule is met, and we stick to the periods
between Kernel release and Sakai code freeze we should achieve the
following release dates for Sakai 2.6 and Sakai NG Beta.

    * Release Sakai 2.6 with K1 GA March 2009
    * Release Sakai NG Beta with K2 GA Late May/Early June 2009

*Aug 20 2008* by Ian Boston
I have made a copy of the K1 K2 roadmap into the group, not because we
want to talk about it at length now, but there may well be some impact
that 3.0 discussion have on it and there we will need it for
reference.

This was a copy of Revision 98
