AuthZ Implementation   	  Edit
</group/sakai-kernel/edit/authz-implementation?hl=en>

		

this page is intended to describe the auth z implementation in K2. It is
not complete and contributions are welcome. The code is almost complete
so it really is documenting that code .




AuthZ


We need AuthZ that focuses on the Objects, and provides fast resolution
with minimal database load. It should also be scalable to millinons of
items and be capable of integration with the enterprise sources for
authz information. It is believed that the solution presented here
covers those aspects.


</group/sakai-kernel/web/AuthZResolution.png?hl=en> 

 

On the AuthZResolution service, check() is called with a resource
reference string, and a PermissionQuery. The resource reference is
converted into a ReferencedObject from which a list of
AccessControlStatement(s) is constructed keyed by the query key. A
UserEnvironment object is constructed bound to the session, containing a
list of subjects. Each subject having a set of permission tokens which
is lazy loaded. 

Resolution of the AuthZ check is performent by selecting a set of
AccessControlStatements from the consolidated list of
AccessControlStatements and evaluating each SubjectStatement in turn
against the UserEnvironment. The first matching SubjectStatement
triggers the response of granted or defined specified in the containing
AccessControlStatement.


Scalability.

PermissionQuery is a small set focused on the service. The User
Environment is a single object focued on the User and their session,
this is cached with a TTL. The Referenced object is focused by the
resource reference. All of these objects are in memory and access is via
map lookups. So scalability of auth Z is likely to be limited by the
complexity of the individual ACL and the number of parents of the
Referenced Object in question, rather than the number of Objects in the
system. The current implementation uses caching arround the the ACL's to
eliminate unnecessasry work, and the UserEnvironment object is also
cached with a TTL.


Extensibility

The stucture is extensible by chaining the services that generate the
UserEnvrironmentObject, allowing dynamic subjects to be injected.

Yes,
the ACL lists are ordered lists with either grant or deny on each
element (AccessControlStatement, ACS) and each ACS in the list can be
marked as propagating ( ie inheritable or not)... so I believe its
possible to block inheritance of anything.

I have not had much time to absorb this, but I am curious if the
implementation includes the ability to block inheritance? Thanks, L

I have started to document the AuthZ implementation. very rough....
please anyone who wants to understand it better, take over the page
and fill the documentation out further. There is quite a bit of
implementation detail in the code not on this page. But IMHO it need
to be on the page.
