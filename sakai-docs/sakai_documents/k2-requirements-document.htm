K2 requirements document   	  Edit
</group/sakai-kernel/edit/k2-requirements-document?hl=en>

		


        This page is a working space for Laura & Sandra to collate
        "official" requirements. Please don't edit it yet, it's not
        complete :)  and don't worry about the content, it's still a
        work in progress.

 

 


    K2 requirements


      Executive summary

Sakai Kernel 2 must provide a core set of functionality to manage users,
content site and tools and the associated authorization.  It must have
over 80% test coverage of the code and be well documented.  The
development of Kernel 2 will be driven by documented requirements and
provide a pathway for backwards compatibility with Kernel 1 based Sakai
tools. 

 

K2 will provide a platform which allows for more flexible arrangements
of content and activities, resulting in a richer field for usability
improvements, and which will also be more resilient and scalable to
drive down the cost of deployment. K2 will lower the cost of maintenance
within the kernel itself, in terms of development effort required, and
will lower the difficulty (in terms of manhours) for both mainstream and
niche developments. Where possible, 3rd party systems/code should be
used to minimise the custom code base.

As well as the requirements detailed here, K2 will use improved project
processes to ensure clear documentation, rapid and efficient development
and accountability.
 

The K2 release (K2 GA Release) must be available for use in Sakai NG
Beta (Sakai 3.0 RC?), for production in early adopter institutions July
2009.


      Top level requirements areas

Scalability

At least 2k users per instance, session state sharing between nodes.
Unloaded all requests must take < 10ms. Session storage should be <20K.
The database should have the ability to be partitioned, ie. multiple
backend databases.  90% of the traffic between the UI and the server to
be hyper efficient HTTP GET's.

 

Backwards Compatibility

A pathway must exist for K1 tools and services to work in a K2
environment. Where a K1 API is deprecated or modiﬁed there will be a K1
- K2 compatibility API and implementation JAR

 

Easier and Quicker to use

A java developer should be able to get up and running in < 30 minutes
after downloading, as a kernel developer or kernel user.   Eclipse
artifacts should be removed from SVN. Tools should supply their own
scripts for special configuration needs, eg adding local libraries to
classpath. There should be no critical "Problems" in the Eclipse build.

 

Flexible, User Centered Structure

Unbind objects from the site structure to make them shareable between
contexts and owned by individuals. Where appropriate content objects
should be referenced by URI and stored in a form suitable for use in the
client (eg JSON files on disk for use by Javascript).  Requirements are
User Centered Data Requirements
</group/sakai-kernel/web/User%20Centered%20Data%20Requirements?hl=en>

 

Offline friendly

K2 /must/should/ not prevent development of an offline client system,
even if the offline client is not available at this time 

 

User privacy and presence

K2 should support enhanced presence. Presence in a site or within Sakai
should be able to update at an appropriate rate without unacceptable
load. Users should be able to select high privacy (visible only to those
who are organising their teaching/research work, or to everyone, or to 
groups with different levels of privacy)

 

Object focused permissions

Attach permissions to Objects and provide a scalable (technical and
human) mechanism for managing those permissions.

 

Upgrade Pathway

A mechanism must exist by which existing installations can be migrated
into a K2 installation.

 

Code test coverage

All kernel code must have at least 80% coverage (in terms of lines and
scenarios) by unit tests run on every kernel build


Build quality

The infrastructure for kernel development must drive build quality by
enforcing use of good practice for test and documentation (style,
javadocs, findbugs)


Better transaction management
Transactions should be managed on a scoped basis with mechanisms for
building a transaction scope in request (the default) or on demand. 


Better Persistence support
Non Hibernate ORM support but this needs careful evaluation and
selection to enable support of non kernel ORM support where applicable. 


Full cluster wide event support.
Better support for real cluster wide event propagation with a focus on
scalability and transaction boundaries. Probably JMS based. Is this
required for the first release of K2?


Better support for cluster wide session data
The kernel should assume sessions are mobile in the cluster and provide
appropriate support regardless of if tools are suitable for operating in
that environment.

 

OpenSocial will be integrated into Sakai

Google's Shindig implementation of OpenSocial (OpenSocial REST API,
gadgets server, and interfaces) will be integrated into Sakai, offering
gadgets into a gadget-capable container and storing within the content store

 

Multi Tenancy

K2 /must/should/ support more than one distinct organization per
installation.    This support should permit skinning for each
organisation, whilst everything uses the same JVM and tomcat instances.
(Multitenancy may be something which could be separated from core K2 and
implemented later) Multitenancy requirements
</group/sakai-kernel/web/Multitenancy%20requirements?hl=en>


Security

K2 /must/should/ be provably secure.



    Kernel 2 components

AuthZ - Replaced by ACL’s on objects in custom implementation?


Cluster - Replaced by custom implementation, perhaps based on JMS?

 

Email - Re-factored may use 3rd party library TBD 

 

Content Store - a simplified replacement for Content. Storing content as
content (being aware of relational stuff). Draft requirements which are
not in "official" form: here
</group/sakai-kernel/web/content-store-requirements?hl=en>
 

Events - JMS provided by Apache ActiveMQ 


JCR - Integrated into JCR Storage service. This will store content as
files with properties. 


Log - Deprecated external visibility internal to kernel 


Cache - Full cluster wide Caching, using a 3rd party implementation.  A
greatly simpliﬁed cluster wide cache implementation and API is the goal


Thread Local - review and re-factoring of current implementation 


Site, User, Tool - Built on top of a mixture of Content Store with the
relational index


Component manager - should be lightweight and reloadable


Transactions- ?


ORM - replacing old DB. The ORM should not need to be in shared.


Relational index - replacing Alias


Resolver - ?



 

 

Time - Deprecated, no use in Kernel 

 

Entity - Replaced by Content Store, Relational Index and Resolver


Alias - Probably replaced by relational index and smart hierarchies

 

DB - Deprecated,  integrated with new transaction semantics.
Functionality provided by ORM, no use in Kernel 


Content - Re-factored and simpliﬁed into Content Store 

 

Memory - Replaced by 3rd party Cache implementation with a simpliﬁed API

Hierarchy alone is probably insufficient as it only covers structural
things, but you would have to apply it to all aspects and that might
just be more complicated.
Where would a user be placed in a Hierarchy ?
How would their grades work?
What about aggregation of grades?
Does a tool that understands hierarchy combine the persons data or not ?

*Aug 28 2008* by Clay Fenlason
But apart from a few details that may be tackled another way (e.g. the
URLs) how is this different from a robust hierarchy? In some respects
it seems worse (e.g. the separation of tenants seems a stiffer wall of
separation when we more often see a demand for combinations and
cross-listings of various sorts).

*Aug 28 2008* by Clay Fenlason
If I've understood things John's said in the past correctly, then
offline Sakai is not a 3.0 requirement, but it is a requirement for
the Sakai 3 series. So K2 should simply not militate against it.
Is it helpful to develop a rough picture of a K3 as well at this
stage? It's at least one place to start placing kernel "shoulds" that
